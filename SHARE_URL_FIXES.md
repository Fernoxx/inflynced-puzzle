# Share URL Fix - Updated Implementation

## Issue Identified
The share function was showing `https://inflyncedpuzzle.vercel.app/` instead of the correct miniapp URL `https://farcaster.xyz/miniapps/HUfrM_bUX-VR/inflyncedpuzzle`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the **account association** in `farcaster.json` having the vercel.app domain encoded in base64:
```json
"payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJpbmZseW5jZWRwdXp6bGUudmVyY2VsLmFwcCJ9"
```
When decoded: `{"domain":"inflyncedpuzzle.vercel.app"}`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Share Function** 
- **Location**: `src/InflyncedPuzzle.js` lines 526-545
- **Changes**:
  - Added URL directly to the text message
  - Changed embeds format from `[appUrl]` to `[{url: appUrl}]`
  - Added debugging console logs
  - Improved error handling and fallback

### 2. **Improved Text Format**
```javascript
const text = `ðŸ§© I solved the InflyncedPuzzle in ${timeInSeconds} seconds!\n\nCan you beat my time? Try it now! ðŸ‘‡\n\n${appUrl}`;
```

### 3. **Enhanced Embeds Format**
```javascript
const result = await sdkInstance.actions.composeCast({
  text: text,
  embeds: [{
    url: appUrl
  }]
});
```

### 4. **Added Debugging**
```javascript
console.log('ðŸ”„ Attempting to share with URL:', appUrl);
```

## Multiple Fallback Layers

1. **Primary**: Farcaster `composeCast` with embeds
2. **Secondary**: URL included in text message
3. **Tertiary**: Web Share API
4. **Final**: Clipboard fallback

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, test the share function by:
1. Completing a puzzle
2. Clicking "Share Result"
3. Verifying the shared content shows the correct miniapp URL

## Expected Behavior

The share should now include:
- The completion time message
- The correct miniapp URL: `https://farcaster.xyz/miniapps/HUfrM_bUX-VR/inflyncedpuzzle`
- Call-to-action text

## Note on Account Association

The account association in `farcaster.json` still contains the vercel.app domain. To completely fix this, you would need to:
1. Update the domain in the account association
2. Re-sign with your private key
3. Update the farcaster.json file

However, the current fix should override this by explicitly providing the correct URL in both the text and embeds.

## Build Status
âœ… **Build successful** - ready for deployment
âœ… **Share function enhanced** with multiple fallback layers
âœ… **URL correctly embedded** in text message
âœ… **Debugging added** for troubleshooting

Deploy this version and test the share functionality!
