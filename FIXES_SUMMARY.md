# Farcaster Miniapp Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Package.json Syntax Error**
- **Problem**: Missing comma in the `scripts` section between `"eject"` and `"vercel-build"`
- **Fix**: Added missing comma to fix JSON syntax error
- **Location**: `package.json` line 20

### 2. **Unused SDK Variable (ESLint Warning)**
- **Problem**: Global `sdk` variable was declared but never used
- **Fix**: Removed unused global SDK variable and its initialization code
- **Location**: `src/InflyncedPuzzle.js` lines 5-15
- **Reason**: The SDK was being re-imported in the `initializeFarcasterSDK` function, making the global variable redundant

### 3. **Unused endTime Variable (ESLint Warning)**
- **Problem**: `endTime` state variable was declared and set but never read/used
- **Fix**: Removed unused `endTime` state variable and its setter
- **Location**: `src/InflyncedPuzzle.js` lines 41 and 388
- **Reason**: The variable was being set when game completed but never used for any functionality

### 4. **Improved Ready Call Implementation**
- **Problem**: `sdk.actions.ready()` was only called when in Farcaster context
- **Fix**: Always call `sdk.actions.ready()` after app loads, regardless of context
- **Location**: `src/InflyncedPuzzle.js` lines 51-72
- **Reason**: According to Farcaster documentation, ready() must ALWAYS be called to dismiss splash screen

## Current Implementation

The app now correctly:
1. **Imports the Farcaster SDK** dynamically when needed
2. **Calls `sdk.actions.ready()`** immediately after app initialization
3. **Handles SDK unavailability gracefully** with proper error handling
4. **Builds without warnings** (only dependency source map warnings remain, which are not our code)
5. **Runs properly** in both Farcaster and standalone contexts

## Key Changes Made

```javascript
// Before: Conditional ready call
if (isInFarcaster) {
  await sdk.actions.ready();
}

// After: Always call ready
await sdk.actions.ready();
```

## Verification

- ✅ Build successful with no ESLint errors
- ✅ App starts and runs without crashes
- ✅ Ready call properly implemented according to documentation
- ✅ All unused variables removed
- ✅ JSON syntax errors fixed

## Next Steps

The app is now ready for deployment and should work correctly as a Farcaster miniapp. The `sdk.actions.ready()` call will properly dismiss the splash screen when the app loads in Farcaster clients.
